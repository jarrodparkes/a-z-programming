# Backstory

Today, I am embarking on a quest of EPOCHal proportions. I will write a unique program in 26 different programming languages beginning with the letters 'A' through 'Z'.

(some may be slightly esoteric...)

And why you might ask? For glam? For glory? Nay, for fun!

Recently, my "Language Documentation" bookmarks for Google Chrome surpassed fitting. And naturally for the nearly OCD, I thought to myself, it would be nice to have a link for a language starting with each letter of the alphabet. So, I quickly Google'd and completed my list. Then, I shifted focus from just passively having new reading material to wanting to build something! And...just like that, the idea was born.
